# Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)

The SLU Benchmark used for the **LeBenchmark** is **MEDIA** (link toward the data coming soon).

The system used is based on Sequence-to-Sequence models. The encoder is similar to the pyramidal LSTM-based encoder proposed in the [Listen, attend and spell paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01211).
